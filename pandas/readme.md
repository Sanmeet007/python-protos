This is an awesome library made by developer for data crazy devs. This library is just a simple implementation of the most famous `pandas` lib used by data scientist for visualizing data.

## General Overview

- Makes your data feel alive .
- You can filter , print , convert and do lot more with this.
- Uses prettytable , json , json2html like libraries under the hood for better functioning.
- Made by dev for devs and data scientists ^\_^

### Dependencies :

- `json2html` : for converting data_list to html table
- `prettytable` : for printing tables using ascii

### DataFrame Class :

This is the main class which is responsible for generating methods and atrributes which can be used for data filetering and other stuff.
It takes a list as paramter , this list is then processed by it's initializer where all the magic happens !

#### Sample code

This is an example of how to use DataFrame class to pretty print tables and make your data alive.

1. Declaring a variable which stores the instance of the DataFrame class (i.e. now variable stores `DataFrame object`)

   ```python
   data = DataFrame(
       [
           {
               "id": 1,
               "body": "Hello wolrdEnim sunt ex cupidatat occaecat eiusmod aute .",
               "uuid": "ghjk3878j321134",
               "color": "red",
           },
           {
               "id": 2,
               "body": "Ex aute adipisicing esse do excepteur dolore. ",
               "uuid": "eihr8rhre8013nqfwe-9u",
           },
           {
               "id": 3,
               "body": "Elit consectetur nisi esse fugiat anim irure.",
               "uuid": "b08349m320m=-081",
           },
       ]
   )

   ```

1. Printing the DataFrame object to console

   ```python
   print(data)
   ```

---

## DataFrame methods

- `data.to_list()` : returns the current DataFrame object in python list.
- `data.to_json()` : converts the current DataFrame object to json format.
- `data.to_html()` : converts the current DataFrame object to html table.

---

## Data attributes

### Basics :

These are basically the keys common to the all the items passed as a dict wrapped around list , these are generated on the fly and have thier own methods and comparsion operations these can be used to cycle through each element and find out a paricular element which statisfies the condition.

> NOTE : if one or two elements miss a certain key then the DataFrame initialzer generates it for you which is initialized with a value of `None`

Here's how these are generated :

```python
    data = DataFrame([{
        "id" : "some_value" ,
        "__attr": "..." # just an example
    }])
    # DataFrame's initializer generates these .id and other attrs automatically
    data.id
```

### Printing the attributes :

When a DataFrame attribute is printed it prints out the attributes in indexed order .

```python
    print(data.id)
```

---

## Data attribute operations & methods :

Here are some opertaions or methods you can use or call on attributes inorder to filter your data\*list. Remember these operations are methods are called for each item in the data\*list and then compared against the statement ... Hence returning a dataframe `_dbool` object which when used with `data[_dbool]` returns a filtered out items.

> To print the filtered data_list just use the simple print function . Example print(data)

### Comparison statements :

In general, a comparison statement is simply a statement in which two quantities or values are being compered. So , these are used to compare the attribute values automatically generated by the DataFrame initializer.

#### 1. Lesser than (<)

With < we can filter out those ids in data with a value lesser than the desired integer. Consider the example below , it returns a new DataFrame object with filtered ids :

```python
    data[data.id < 5]
```

#### 2. Lesser than equal to (<=)

With <= we can filter out those ids in data with a value lesser than the desired integer. Consider the example below , it returns a new DataFrame object with filtered ids :

```python
    data[data.id <= 5]
```

#### 3. Greater than (>)

With > we can filter out those ids in data with a value greater than the desired integer. Consider the example below , it returns a new DataFrame object with filtered ids :

```python
    data[data.id > int(5)]
```

#### 4. Greater than equal to (>=)

With >= we can filter out those ids in data with a value greater than or equal to the desired integer. Consider the example below , it returns a new DataFrame object with filtered ids :

```python
    desired_int = 1
    data[data.id  >= desired_int]
```

#### 5. Equals (==)

With == we can filter out those ids in data with a value equal to the desired left side value. Consider the example below , it returns a new DataFrame object with filtered colors:

```python
    desired_color = "red"
    x = data[data.color == desired_color]
    print(x)
```

> NOTE : If `data.id == 10` is prinited then a \_dbool object is printed.

### Using methods on attributes as statements :

#### 1. Ends with method

Returns the \_dbool object with only those index of color being true which ends the sepcific string or character

```python
    data.color.endswith("i")
```

#### 2. Starts with method

Returns the \_dbool object with only those index of color being true which starts the sepcific string or character

```python
    val = "r"
    data.color.startswith(val)
```

#### 3. Includes method

Returns the \_dbool object with only those index of color being true which includes the sepcific string or character

```python
    val = "ed"
    data.color.include(val)
```

### Chaining statements (Logical) :

#### 1. Logical and (&)

Performs basic `and` operation ,
& comapres two `\_dbool` object and returns a new `\_dbool` object which can be used against the orignal DataFrame object to get the desired items. Example:

```python
    # Note : The operator precedence is also important !
    print(data[(data.id == 1) & (data.color.icludes("ed")) ])
```

> Note : Use bitwise and (&) instead of logical and (and) operator to perform and logic.

#### 2. Logical or ( | )

Performs basic `or` operation ,
| comapres two `\_dbool` object and returns a new `\_dbool` object which can be used against the orignal DataFrame object to get the desired items. Example:

```python
    # Note : The operator precedence is also important !
    print(data[(data.id > 2) | (data.color.icludes("ed"))])
```

> Note : Use bitwise and (&) instead of logical and (and) operator to perform and logic.

## Inbuilt Objects & Classes:

- ### DataFrame boolean :

  The `_dbool` sub-class is used to create an object from it which is used for comparsion , logical statements and finally used by DataFrame to print only the values returned true

- ### DataFrame attribute :

  The `data.$attr` is an instance of DataFrame attribute class ( generated at run time )
